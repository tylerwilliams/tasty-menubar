TODO
------------------------

DONE - app icon
DONE - preferences window gets focus
DONE - incognito mode must work
DONE - ask to start at login on first launch
DONE - re-enable MRC on non-arc classes that I heavy-handedly "fixed"
- sparkle auto-update
DONE - preferences window does not always get focus
DONE - app does not start on login, despite being in login items...
- coherent logging in console.app, ideally with a log dir + file
- profile and reduce memory usage! (possibly move away from ARC)
